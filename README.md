# Coffee Shop Project

Using object-oriented programming principles, create a Python application from scratch to model a Coffee Shop domain. 
This assessment will test your ability to design classes, implement methods, establish relationships between objects, and handle data appropriately.

## Overview

The project includes three main classes:

- Customer
- Coffee
- Order

## Relationships

- A Customer can have many Orders
- A Coffee can have many Orders
- An Order belongs to one Customer and one Coffee

This creates a many-to-many relationship between Customer and Coffee through Order.
